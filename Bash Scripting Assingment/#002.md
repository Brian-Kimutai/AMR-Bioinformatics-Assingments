## Assingment Quiz,
### Best ways to write commit messages;

1. Capitalization and Punctuation: Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using Conventional Commits, remember to use all lowercase.

2. Mood: Use imperative mood in the subject line. Example â€“ Add fix for dark mode toggle state. Imperative mood gives the tone you are giving an order or request.

3. Type of Commit: Specify the type of commit. It is recommended and can be even more beneficial to have a consistent set of words to describe your changes. Example: Bugfix, Update, Refactor, Bump,Add and so on. 

4. Length: The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters, and the body should be restricted to 72 characters.

5. Content: Be direct, try to eliminate filler words and phrases in these sentences (examples: though, maybe, I think, kind of).
