### Quiz 3
> Document on the different types of BLAST

- BLAST stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. Its a widely used suite of programs for searching and comparing biological sequences. 
- There are several different types of BLAST programs, each designed for specific types of sequence similarity searches. 
- Here are some of the main types of BLAST:
  
  1. BLASTN (Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST): Used for comparing a nucleotide query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database.
Commonly used for DNA sequence alignments.
  2. BLASTP (Protein-Protein BLAST): Used for comparing a protein query sequence against a protein sequence database.
This is the most common BLAST type for protein sequence similarity searches.
  3. BLASTX (Nucleotide-Protein BLAST): Used for comparing a nucleotide query sequence (typically a DNA sequence) against a protein sequence database.
It translates the nucleotide query sequence in all six reading frames and compares the resulting amino acid sequences against the protein database.
  4. TBLASTN (Protein-Nucleotide BLAST): Used for comparing a protein query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database.
It translates the nucleotide database sequences in all six reading frames and compares the resulting amino acid sequences against the protein query.
  5. TBLASTX (Nucleotide-Nucleotide Translated BLAST):
Used for comparing a nucleotide query sequence (typically a DNA sequence) against a nucleotide sequence database.
It translates both the query and database sequences in all six reading frames, comparing the resulting amino acid sequences.
